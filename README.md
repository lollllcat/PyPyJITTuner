Assessing and Optimizing the Performance Impact of the Just-in-time Conguration Parameters - A Case Study on PyPy
====================

This is the replications package for paper 'Assessing and Optimizing the Performance Impact of the Just-in-time Conguration Parameters - A Case Study on PyPy'. The package is composed with two parts:

PyPyJITTuner:
-----------------
This part provides a tool with which we can tune PyPy's JIT configurations for different applications to optimize their performance.

A more detailed introduction about how to use the tool can be found in the README.md file in PyPyJITTuner.

Results_and_scripts:
----------------
This part provides the result and scripts in our empirical study and case study. Also, a more detailed introduction can be found in the README.md file of Results_and_Scripts.
