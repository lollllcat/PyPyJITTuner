SETUP
==================
This part contains the results and parsing scripts for empirical study (from 3.1 to 3.3) and case study (from 5.1 to 6.5)

To re-run the results, we need to firstly setup the python and R environment:
1. Any python2 can be used: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install R:
     a. install R in ubuntu: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-18-04
     b. install package 'effectsize'.with R command: install.packages('effectsize')


Re-run the scripts
===================
For each of sections, the intermediate results and scripts are already avaialble. We just need to run the corresponding scripts to get the results for the section.

Also, for each section, we can check the corresponding section in the paper to understand how we did the study.
